## Contributing

This is an open source project. PACKAGE_NAME wouldn't be where it is now without
contributions by the community. Please consider forking PACKAGE_NAME to improve,

To protect the interests of the PACKAGE_NAME contributors, Appcelerator, customers

minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will
locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for
subsequent submissions.
